# 3D-Solar-System-Explorer
The 3D Solar System Explorer is a Python-based educational simulation that  visualizes our solar system in an interactive, animated 3D-like interface. The project is  developed using Tkinter, Pythonâ€™s built-in GUI library, and enhanced with advanced  mathematical modeling to simulate orbital dynamics and perspective-based 3D  visualization.
